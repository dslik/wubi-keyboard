Next batch of PCBs came in:

From top to bottom:
- Front panel
- OLED Holder
- Spacer
- Keyboard plate
- Keyboard PCB

When it's all assembled, it looks like this:

It's a little difficult to see in this photo, but there are two OLED displays at the top of the keyboard.

Everything fits nicely, but I am worried about the OLEDs not having any protection, so I want to find some sheets of acrylic that I can put on top of each display to protec them.

Next steps are sourcing some 2mm acrylic and figuring out how to have it cut, and updating the PCBs to hold the acrylic in place.

The updated keyboard plates came in, and everything fits now.

Here's a full mechanical test of the keyboard:

Everything looks good, and more importantly, typing on it feels good.

The two-button keys require a little more force to press, but not enough to be annoying.

Next steps involve getting the display interface working, so I can update the main PCB to add the display connectors.
